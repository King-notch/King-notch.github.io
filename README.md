## About Me

I’m an **introverted yet strong communicator** who values teamwork, patience, and fairness.  
Currently, I’m seeking **internship opportunities** as a **Sales Trainee** or **HR Assistant**, with the goal of growing into a **full-time position** if the role suits me well.  

I believe in learning by doing — gaining real-world experience while contributing value to organizations that care about people and progress.
